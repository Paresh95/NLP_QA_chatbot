# NLP_QA_chatbot



Task:
Develop API endpoints that accept call transcripts or documents of similar length as input. These endpoints should generate responses to user inquiries based on the content of the documents. For instance, if a user asks, 'What is the client's salary?' and the salary information is mentioned within the call transcript, the system should return that specific detail. Conversely, if the query pertains to information not covered in the transcript, the system should reply with 'This wasn't discussed in the call.' Each uploaded document will be linked to a specific user, necessitating a unique ID for each user. Please provide the complete code with detailed comments. Essentially, we are looking for a simple question-and-answer chatbot. What interests us most is your methodological approach—such as the accuracy of the responses, choice of embeddings, etc.—and the reasoning behind your decisions, like 'Why did you choose this particular chain_type?' Lastly, deploy the application in a way that allows us to test it.




This document appears to be a transcript of a conversation between a financial advisor and a client discussing the client's financial situation and retirement planning. They cover topics such as the client's pension pots, tax implications of withdrawing from the pension, the possibility of the client moving house and needing additional funds, and the client's income and expenditure. The financial advisor provides reassurance that the client is financially independent and can afford to retire without needing to work for money. They also discuss the client's dogs, the weather, and personal updates, reflecting a friendly and personal advisor-client relationship. Towards the end, they plan to follow up after Christmas to reassess the client's financial needs and withdrawals from their pension.
